# IRIS-FGM

IRIS-CEM provides an R environment for integrating [LTMG](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/18/e111/5542876) and [QUBIC2](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btz692/5567116)

## Abstract
Single-cell RNA-Seq data is useful in discovering cell heterogeneity and signature genes in specific cell populations in cancer and other complex diseases. Specifically, the investigation of functional gene modules (FGM) can help to understand gene interactive networks and complex biological processes. QUBIC2 is recognized as one of the most efficient and effective tool for FGM identification from scRNA-Seq data. However, its availability is limited to a C implementation and its applicative power is affected by only a few downstream analyses functionalities. We developed an R package named IRIS-FGM (integrative scRNA-Seq interpretation system for functional gene module analysis) to support the investigation of FGMs and cell clustering using scRNA-Seq data. Empowered by QUBIC2, IRIS-FGM can identify co-expressed and co-regulated FGMs, predict types/clusters, identify differentially expressed genes, and perform functional enrichment analysis. It is noteworthy that IRIS-FGM also applies Seurat objects that can be easily used in the Seurat vignettes.

## Environment

We recommend user to install IRIS-FGM on large memory (32GB) based UNIX/Linux operation system if user aims at analyzing bicluster-based co-expression analysis; if user aims at analyzing data by quick mode, we recommend to install IRIS-FGM on small memeory (8GB) based Windows or linux operation system; IRIS-FGM does not support MAC. 
We will assum you have the following installed:
R (equal or greater than 3.5)

# Usage

## Pre-installation
1. Install required packages from CRAN. 

```install.packages(c('BiocManager','devtools', 'AdaptGauss', "pheatmap", 'mixtools','MCL', 'anocva', 'qgraph','Rtools','ggpubr',"ggraph","Seurat"))```
                   
2. Install required package from Bioconductor.  

```BiocManager::install(c('org.Mm.eg.db','multtest','org.Hs.eg.db','clusterProfiler','DEsingle', 'DrImpute','scater', 'scran'))```

3. Install IRIS-FGM from github.

```devtools::install_github("BMEngineeR/IRIS-FGM", force = T)```

Now the MetaQUBIC is successfully installed and ready for use.
